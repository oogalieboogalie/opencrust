# OpenCrust

**The secure, lightweight open-source AI agent framework.**

A single 17 MB binary that runs your AI agents across Telegram, Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, and iMessage — with encrypted credential storage, config hot-reload, and 13 MB of RAM at idle. Built in Rust for the security and reliability that AI agents demand.
